                <p><strong>creating co-operatively run language
                models</strong></p>
                <p>Many popular language models today are created by
                large, for-profit technology companies and serve the
                goals of these corporations. What would a language model
                look like if it was created by writers and to serve
                their creative community? Can we envision a co-operative
                language model that challenges existing notions of how
                technology is created and who it can serve?</p>
                <h2 id="metaphors-for-model-governance">METAPHORS FOR
                MODEL GOVERNANCE</h2>
                <p>How would we govern a language model run for and by
                creative writers? We have collected over one hundred
                “metaphors for models” – projects, activities,
                collectives, locations that may make good metaphors for
                how to create and run a language model. For instance,
                what if a language model was like a community vegetable
                garden? Or a seed bank? Or the bathroom in a dive
                bar?</p>
                <p>Below are some metaphors we have investigated
                deeply:</p>
                <h3 id="community-garden">Community Garden</h3>
                <p>Community gardens are small plots of land where local
                community members can be allotted a part of the plot to
                grow plants. This is often in urban areas where people
                may not have a backyard or may not have enough light in
                their yard or porch to grow what they would like.
                Community gardens tend to be free, but may have long
                wait times to get an allocation if they are popular.
                It’s run by volunteers who likely have their own
                allocation. Sometimes these gardens are fenced off to
                prevent animals from entering, but often they are not
                locked; anyone can come in and look around and there is
                no need to get a key or anything similar.</p>
                <p>What if a language model was like a community
                garden?</p>
                <p><strong>Who are the data contributors?</strong> The
                data is probably the garden contents: dirt, seeds,
                plants, flowers, vegetables, etc. While people bring
                their own seeds, the garden probably provides the dirt
                and maybe water. For a language model, this suggests
                that the members bring data to fine-tune the model on,
                but get to “own” model outputs (akin to the vegetables
                they grew). Probably members fine-tune their own version
                of the model, similar to how each garden member has
                their own allotment for growing. Since the garden
                provides the dirt, a “community garden” language model
                is probably fine-tuned on a shared existing model and
                the community independently hosts the shared model and
                the fine-tune versions (in the same way land is
                provided).</p>
                <p><strong>Who are the model users?</strong> The users
                are the same people who provide the data. Users would be
                co-located in some way, akin to a community garden being
                open to those living within a certain physical distance
                of the garden. Since everyone gets their own allotment
                in a shared space, maybe everyone’s model is accessible
                to others, but it’s considered rude to “take” from
                another person’s model. (Just like you wouldn’t pick
                your neighbors tomatoes.) Instead, you just get to look
                on.</p>
                <p><strong>Who are the model stewards?</strong>
                Community members volunteer to steward the garden. This
                means they manage the digital infrastructure, invite new
                members when old members leave, and make sure the
                community stays “tidy”. This could involve making sure
                that fine-tuning models is easy for new-comers, making
                sure that fine-tuned models are accessible, and updating
                shared base models when appropriate.</p>
                <p><strong>What else does this metaphor
                suggest?</strong> In this metaphor, it’s worth
                considering where the “land” comes from, which for a
                language model probably represents compute resources:
                model hosting and GPUs for training. In a community
                garden, it comes from the local municipality or council,
                which decides to take a lot of land that was otherwise
                not used or used for something else and makes it
                available to the community. This may mean that a
                “community garden” language model gets donated compute
                resources from some sort of community organization. This
                could be a university, a non-profit, maybe an
                independent art school, or even a local government that
                has compute resources.</p>
                <h2 id="workshops-on-metaphors-for-models">WORKSHOPS ON
                METAPHORS FOR MODELS</h2>
                <p>Starting in February 2025, we ran a series of
                workshops to envision what a community-run creative
                language model could look like. These workshops seeded
                the analysis of “metaphors for models”. Below we
                summarize the workshops as a whole, and provide our
                materials for those interested in running their own. If
                you would like us to run a workshop with your community,
                please reach out ____.</p>

                <h2 id="history-of-the-project">HISTORY OF THE
                PROJECT</h2>
                <p>This project arose from a research study we conducted
                on how creative writers reason about the use of their
                writing as training data for large language models.
                Check out the published paper here.</p>
                <p>Large language models (LLMs) present significant
                ethical concerns across a number of dimensions—from
                resource overuse to labor exploitation to intellectual
                theft. At the same time, LLMs have also demonstrated
                potential as artistic, pedagogical, and humanistic
                tools. Yet, as our previous study revealed, the problems
                with available LLMs make many people unwilling to use
                them, even if such models are humanistically
                interesting.</p>
                <p>There are ongoing efforts to reign in corporate LLMs,
                such as lawsuits to prevent the unconsensual use of
                writing as training data, and … There are also efforts
                to document and create more ethically-minded LLMs, such
                as the European Open Source AI Index to track how open
                LLMs truly are and OLMo, a state-of-the-art, truly open
                language model with inspectable training data. These are
                important efforts, but can remain distant for specific
                communities that may want to engage with this technology
                directly and on their own terms.</p>
                <p>Our aim is to shepherd writer-led and contributed
                language models, where “creative writing as training
                data” is well-documented, full consent is provided by
                all contributing writers, and use cases are recorded and
                shared with community members. The training datasets and
                models will be guided by a community board. Such models
                would provide an ethical LLM options and be designed to
                prioritize community values like diversity and
                creativity.</p>
